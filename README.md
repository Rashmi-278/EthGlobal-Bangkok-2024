# ETHGlobal- Bangkok 2024

For this hackathon, I choose the learning and exploring path where I mainly read about different projects and understood what they provide and how they contribute to the Web3 Ecosystem.
Later, I focused on learning about Oracles with Pyth Network and tested their API Endpoints. 

This repo contains my log of developer exeperience going through docs, testing API's and feedback. Find it at `pythnetwork-docs-feedback.md`

After exploring Pyth-Entropy which provides verifiable random numbers, I built Pyth-in-Galaxy
Which is a story of a baby Snake named Pyth traveling the universe, his spaceship is powered by Pyth-Entropy and sometimes as in life we are unable to reach the destinations we planned to reach, here in our baby snake's case, he sometimes is unable to reach some galaxies because his spaceship cant find the map to reach it. But that doesn't discourage him and he keeps on going forward traveling to new galaxies. pspspsssspspspps :)
