# ETHGlobal Bangkok 2024  

At this hackathon, I chose to take the learning and exploration route. Instead of building something right away, I spent my time diving into a few projects, figuring out what they do, and how they contribute to the Web3 ecosystem.  

### Exploring Oracles and Pyth Network  

I focused on learning about oracles, especially the [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/), which provides reliable, verifiable data for smart contracts. I tested their API endpoints, explored their use cases, and documented my developer journey and feedback in [`pythnetwork-docs-feedback.md`](./pythnetwork-docs-feedback.md).  

### Pyth-in-Galaxy  

After getting familiar with **Pyth-Entropy**—a service for generating verifiable random numbers—I built **Pyth-in-Galaxy**, a story about **Pyth**, a baby snake on a cosmic adventure.  

Pyth’s spaceship, powered by Pyth-Entropy, helps him explore different galaxies. But, like in life, there are times when he can’t reach his destination because his spaceship can’t find the map (or, in API terms, an endpoint fails). That doesn’t stop Pyth, though—he keeps going, discovering new galaxies, and enjoying the journey.
