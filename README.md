# ETHGlobal- Bangkok 2024

For this hackathon, I choose the learning and exploring path where I mainly read about different projects and understood what they provide and how they contribute to the Web3 Ecosystem.
Later, I focused on learning about Oracles with Pyth Network and tested their API Endpoints. 

This repo contains my log of developer exepereince going through docs, testing API's and feedback.
